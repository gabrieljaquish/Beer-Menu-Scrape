# Beer-Menu-Scrape

This little program's intent is to gather data from around the web regarding Beer
Beer styles, prices, and breweries to be exact.

As the owner of a very small brewery, i try to keep up on what beers are selling for in my area.
if a particular style of beer is more expensive, and what isn generally on tap.

This helps me keep an eye on the craft beer market on a local level by targeting only the bars on my area.

The eventual hope for this program is to write this data on a daily basis to a SQL database.
Currently it is just a simple python script to scrape data out of tables found at beermenus.com

beermenus.com provides bars, restaurants and breweries with a method of posting their current drafts online.
scaping the data from local establishments that use beermenus.com can help build historical pricing information.
